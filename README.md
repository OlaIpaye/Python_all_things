# Python_all_things

A resource for Learning Python.

## Why I am Learning Python

After applying to the Makers Coding Bootcamp, I was given a 3 step assestment to complete within 10 days of my application form being accepted. So the first task is to get started with Python.

Upon starting Paython on 08-04-2024, I have been amazaed at how powerful and easy the syntax is to understand and grasp especially with my knowledge of JavaScript. So this resource was created to help me keep learning and explore some advanced conceopts in Python that I want to learn and get great at.

## Goal

**Learn and build 1 project with Python by May 30th.**
